* No issues found besides the suggestion for a h1/h2 at the start of a section. 

## Manual Testing

* Testing on other browsers proved to be problematic. Certain pictures wouldn't turn and glitches would be sent through the browser, have been working on a way round this making bad steps however, some issues are still noticed.

* bug found and fixed where every time the timer was counting the game would move from left to right depending on the number in the timer.
* bug found and fixed where the cards wouldn't flip to their back face.
* bug found and fixed where the cards would flip and would disappear once they flipped.
* bug found where the congratulations message at the end of the game doesn't show up upon completion.
